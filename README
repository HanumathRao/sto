Run single-threaded tests:
./single

Multi-threaded test:
(Change the DATA_STRUCTURE define in concurrent.cc to desired data structure)
Check multithreaded correctness:
./concurrent 3 -c
*runs with 4 threads, 1 million total transactions of size 10 each, half of which are read-writes
If this is too fast:
./concurrent 3 --ntrans=10000000 -c
Check delete multithreaded correctness (not applicable for arrays):
./concurrent 6 -c

Benchmark singlethreaded:
./concurrent 3 --nthreads=1
or
./concurrent 3 --nthreads=1 --ntrans=10000000
Or if you want to test transaction system overhead, read-my-writes overhead, etc.
(larger transactions):
./concurrent 3 --nthreads=1 --opspertrans=100

(and benchmarking multithreaded just involves changing the --nthreads argument).
